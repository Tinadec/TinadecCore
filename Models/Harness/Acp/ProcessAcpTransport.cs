/// Arguments go through <see cref="ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList"/>, never a joined command line:
/// a prompt is arbitrary user text, and quoting it into one string is how an argument becomes a
/// command. Standard output is read as raw bytes through <see cref="Stream.BaseStream"/> rather than
/// a <see cref="StreamReader"/>, because framing decides where a frame ends and a text reader would
/// decide it first.

/// Not handled here: the <c>cmd.exe /d /s /c</c> indirection that npm-installed harnesses want on
/// Windows. Measured on this host, spawning a <c>.cmd</c> directly through <see cref="Process"/>
/// does start, so this is not about reachability — it is about quoting. A batch shim re-parses its
/// argument line under cmd's rules, and a prompt containing <c>&amp;</c>, <c>|</c>, <c>%</c> or a
/// quote does not survive that unchanged. That belongs to <c>HarnessBinaryResolver</c>, which owns
